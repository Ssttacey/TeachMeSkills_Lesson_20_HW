Homework for the twentieth lesson

Task 1.
We created a program that simulates the morning: reading the news, tomorrow, coffee.
The program implements three threads. Each thread is given a name and priority from the config file.
The program is implemented in two options:
using the Runnable interface and using the Thread class.

Task 2.
This program is a simulation of a service station. There can be a maximum of a certain number of cars in service per hundred.
We created a class that runs in a separate thread and adds cars for service to the service station, as well as a class that picks up fixed cars from the service station.
The maximum number of cars available for service is stored in the interface. When writing the program synchronized, wait, notify were used.
